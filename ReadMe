Alright Bitches We need to pick a language to write the editor in and a language for the interpreter.  Personaly Im voting scheme for the later part. All of the python code will be in the repo soon.  If you dont understand how to use git hub (kevin and Merko call me if you need help with basics, pushing, pulling, commiting, and setting up bash), learn it.  write your name and what languages you think we should use in this file and push to the repo ASAP. Additionally, ideally this project will work best if we actually take advantage of the github aspect and commit frequently with well formed messages.  Prevelent and important messages should go in ReadMe for now. Just attach a commit saying its been modified.
